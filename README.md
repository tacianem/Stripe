<h3>Stripe!</h3>

>> Get all candies striped before they get to the ground!! <<

To play just touch and/or drag your finger on the screen (simulated by mouse clicks on PC) to get the candy canes striped! You lose the game if any one of them gets to the bottom blank! 

<strong>Features:</strong>
- Spawnable objects over time that slowly float down the screen
- Touch detection (as it's a mobile game)
- Sound effect for each candy striped (sound from zapsplat.com)
- Game Over text and restart


Enjoy and have fun! :)
